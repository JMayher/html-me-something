            <h2 id="topic">Brief Personal History</h2>
                <p>
                   I was born in Memphis, TN and lived their until I was 8 years old when my dad was transferred to St. Louis. I have lived in the
                   St. Louis area ever since. I graduated from high school and went to community college to save money. After I finished commmunity
                   college I enrolled in a four year university to complete my bachelor's degree. Upon graduating I started looking for a job.

            <h2 id="topic">Career</h2>
                <p>Once I graduated from college I started looking for a job. My first job was working in a mail room at an insurance company. Next I moved on to 
                   work in the Policy Holder Services department at the same insurance company. I then moved on to the life claims department as claims adjuster
                   trainee. While in the department I have been promoted twice and am now a claims specialist. My employer has offered the opportunity to 
                   acquire professional designations through LOMA. I have taken advantage of this opportunity to get my Fellowship of the Life Management Institue&lpar;FLMI&rpar;
                   and Associate of Reinsurance Administration&lpar;ARA&rpar;.
